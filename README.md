	Description: Git is a distributed version control system that tracks versions of files. It is often used to control source code by programmers who are developing software collaboratively.

	Why

•	Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to. Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source.

	When we use it
•	Git is particularly beneficial in large-scale projects involving multiple team members, where efficient version control and collaboration are essential.
